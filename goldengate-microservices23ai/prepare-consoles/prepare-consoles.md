# Connect and prepare databases
## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to launch the Oracle GoldenGate 23ai Microservices WebUI, create a connection to a source database, add transaction information, add a checkpoint table, add a heartbeat table, and create a custom-managed profile in the Oracle GoldenGate East and West 23ai Microservices WebUI.

Estimated time: 20 minutes

### About DB Connections

DB Connections is a database login credential that allows you to connect to a database and manage Checkpoint Tables, Transaction Information, and a Heartbeat Table.

### About Checkpoint table and Trandata

A Checkpoint table is created to add fault tolerance to the replication process. GoldenGate Extract and Replicat processes record their read and write positions to maintain a record of their read position in the trail for recovery purposes. Trandata enables the unconditional logging of the primary key and the conditional supplemental logging of all unique and foreign keys of the specified table.

### About Heartbeat tables

Heartbeat tables monitor lag throughout the data replication cycle. Automatic heartbeats are sent from each source database into the replication streams by updating the records in a heartbeat seed table and a heartbeat table and constructing a heartbeat history record.

### About Managed Process Profiles

A Custom-managed profile provides the name of the auto start and auto restart profile. You can select the default or custom options.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Log in to the Oracle GoldenGate 23ai Microservices WebUI
* Create a Connection to the East and West Source database
* Add transaction data, a checkpoint table, and a heartbeat table
* Create a custom-managed Profile

## Task 1: Add DB Connection to East database

## Task 4: Add DB connection to West database

1. On the Reservation Information page, click on the **ogg\_west\_url** link to access the Oracle GoldenGate West 23ai Microservices WebUI console.

2. To log in to the Oracle GoldenGate West 23ai Microservices WebUI console, enter **oggadmin** for User name and the password, and then click **Sign In**.
